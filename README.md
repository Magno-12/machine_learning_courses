# Detailed Guide on Classification Model Implementations
As an avid learner diving deep into the realms of electronic engineering and systems, I am exploring the intricate details of various classification models in Machine Learning. This journey has led me to curate a guide that demystifies the code behind each model, offering a clearer understanding of their functionalities.

## 1. Decision Tree Classification (decision_tree_classification.py)
This script begins by importing essential libraries and subsequently loading the dataset. It then focuses on Decision Trees â€” hierarchical structures that segment the feature space based on decision rules derived from features that maximize class separation. The code encapsulates data scaling (although not critical for decision trees, included for consistency), model training using entropy as a criterion, and model evaluation using a confusion matrix and accuracy metric.

## 2. K-Nearest Neighbors (k_nearest_neighbors.py)
Following the initial steps of library imports and data loading, this code delves into the K-NN algorithm. The data is split for training and testing, with feature scaling being paramount for distance-based algorithms like K-NN. The script employs the KNeighborsClassifier for model training, selecting 5 as the number of neighbors. Post-training, the model's efficacy is assessed using a confusion matrix and an accuracy score.

## 3. Kernel SVM (kernel_svm.py)
After preliminary steps, this script introduces the concept of Kernel SVM. SVMs aim to find a hyperplane that best divides a dataset into classes. For non-linearly separable data, a kernel trick, in this case, the RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernel, is employed. The model is trained, and its performance is subsequently gauged using evaluation metrics.

## 4. Logistic Regression (logistic_regression.py)
Logistic Regression is a statistical method predicting a binary outcome based on one/multiple predictor variables. The script, after data preparation steps, uses the LogisticRegression class for model training. Despite its simplicity, it's a powerful tool for binary classification tasks. The trained model is then evaluated for its prediction accuracy.

## 5. Naive Bayes (naive_bayes.py)
Naive Bayes classifies based on Bayes' theorem, making a "naive" assumption of feature independence. The script harnesses the GaussianNB implementation post data-prep stages, assuming normally distributed feature data. The model is particularly popular for text classification. Like other scripts, the model's effectiveness is determined using a confusion matrix and accuracy score.

### Running the Scripts
Before diving into the details of each script, it's essential to know how to run them. Ensure you have Python installed and the required libraries. 
You can typically install these using pip:

- pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
